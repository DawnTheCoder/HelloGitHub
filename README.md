# HelloGitHub
This is my hello world GitHub project.
***
## What I want to do?
**More than a coder,but an engineer**<br>
What is the difference between a coder and an engineer?I thought it was **Innovation**.<br>
I like creating & designning,but with my capability,I can't do much more.<br>
The motivation of this github account is that I have determined myself to be a great engineer.<br>
